# Project Title: Currency Arbitrage System

## Description:
The Currency Arbitrage System is a server-side application written in C++ that supports 6 currencies and helps users identify potential arbitrage opportunities. The purpose of this system is to provide users with a tool to easily track and take advantage of differences in exchange rates between currencies.

## Architecture:
The Currency Arbitrage System is a server-side application that uses a data.json file to store exchange rates and estimated profits. The system is built using C++ and includes a class for managing currencies and a form for updating rates. The system is responsive and includes a chatbot feature for assistance. The server is constantly running and uses a graph to track rates, with no data storage or caching.

## Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler
- Access to the data.json file
- Internet connection

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Make sure the data.json file is accessible to the application.
4. Run the application.

## Configuration:
The Currency Arbitrage System does not require any specific environment variables or settings. However, if you are using Azure, you may need to configure the server to allow access to the data.json file.

## Usage:
1. Run the application.
2. Use the form to update exchange rates.
3. The system will automatically detect and display potential arbitrage opportunities.
4. Use the chatbot feature for assistance.

## API Reference:
The Currency Arbitrage System does not expose any APIs.
